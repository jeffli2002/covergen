## Known Issues Found

### Critical Issues
- None found

### Minor Issues
1. **Issue**: Webhook retry logic not fully implemented
   - **Impact**: Low - webhooks may fail without retry
   - **Recommendation**: Implement exponential backoff retry

2. **Issue**: Rate limiting not consistent across all endpoints
   - **Impact**: Medium - potential for abuse
   - **Recommendation**: Standardize rate limiting across payment endpoints

## Test Environment Configuration

```bash
# Required Environment Variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<test-key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service-key>
CREEM_SECRET_KEY=<test-secret>
CREEM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<webhook-secret>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CREEM_TEST_MODE=true
```

## Recommendations

1. **Monitoring**: Implement payment-specific monitoring and alerting
2. **Documentation**: Add inline documentation for webhook event handlers
3. **Testing**: Add more edge cases for partial payments and refunds
4. **Security**: Regular security audits of payment flows
5. **Performance**: Consider caching customer data to reduce API calls

## Next Steps

1. Address identified issues
2. Set up automated test runs in CI/CD pipeline
3. Add monitoring for payment success rates
4. Implement A/B testing for checkout flows
