# Auth Navigation Test Guide

## Test Scenarios for Account Page Navigation Fix

### Prerequisites
1. Clear all cookies and local storage
2. Use the latest deployment from bestAuth branch

### Test 1: Authenticated User Navigation
1. **Setup**: Sign in with Google or email
2. **Action**: Click "Account" button in header
3. **Expected**: 
   - Should navigate directly to `/en/account`
   - NO sign-in modal should appear
   - Account page should load with user data

### Test 2: Unauthenticated User Navigation
1. **Setup**: Ensure you're signed out
2. **Action**: Click "Account" button in header
3. **Expected**:
   - Should redirect to home page with auth parameters
   - URL should be `/en?auth=signin&redirect=/en/account`
   - Sign-in modal should appear
   - After sign in, should redirect to account page

### Test 3: Direct URL Access (Authenticated)
1. **Setup**: Sign in first
2. **Action**: Navigate directly to `/en/account` via URL
3. **Expected**:
   - Account page should load without redirects
   - No sign-in modal should appear

### Test 4: Direct URL Access (Unauthenticated)
1. **Setup**: Sign out
2. **Action**: Navigate directly to `/en/account` via URL
3. **Expected**:
   - Should redirect to `/en?auth=signin&redirect=/en/account`
   - Sign-in modal should appear

### Test 5: Page Refresh on Account Page
1. **Setup**: Sign in and navigate to account page
2. **Action**: Refresh the page (F5)
3. **Expected**:
   - Account page should reload without redirects
   - No sign-in modal should appear
   - User data should load correctly

### Test 6: Navigation Between Pages (Authenticated)
1. **Setup**: Sign in
2. **Action**: Navigate: Home → Account → Payment → Account
3. **Expected**:
   - All navigation should work smoothly
   - No sign-in modals should appear
   - Account page should load each time

### Debug Tools
- Visit `/en/debug-bestauth` to check current auth state
- Check browser console for auth debug logs
- Look for messages like:
  - `[Account] User authenticated: user@email.com`
  - `[AuthModalHandler] User already authenticated, cleaning up URL`

### Common Issues Fixed
1. **Race Condition**: Account page now waits for auth to fully load
2. **Modal Flash**: AuthModalHandler checks if user is authenticated
3. **URL Cleanup**: Auth parameters removed for authenticated users
4. **Loading States**: Proper loading screen during auth check

### Implementation Details
- Added `initialAuthCheck` state to track auth verification
- Added 100ms delay to ensure auth state propagation
- AuthModalHandler skips modal for authenticated users
- Console logging added for debugging auth flow
