## 🎯 Summary of All Changes

### 1. **Watermark Features Repositioned** ✅

**Moved watermark-free features to appear immediately after generation capacity**

**New Order:**
1. Credits (orange highlight)
2. Generation capacity (images/videos)
3. Daily limit (free tier only)
4. **Watermark-free images** ← Moved up
5. **Watermark-free Sora 2 videos** ← Moved up & renamed
6. AI maker tools (6 tools)
7. Usage rights (personal/commercial)
8. No ads (paid tiers)

**Rationale:** Watermark status is a key selling point and should be visible earlier in the feature list.

---

### 2. **"Watermark-free Videos" → "Watermark-free Sora 2 Videos"** ✅

**Changed text and added bold highlight to "Sora 2"**

**Before:**
```
✓ Watermark-free videos
```

**After:**
```
✓ Watermark-free Sora 2 videos
                  ^^^^^^^ (bold/semibold)
```

**Implementation:**
```tsx
<span className="text-sm text-gray-700">
  Watermark-free <span className="font-semibold">Sora 2</span> videos
</span>
```

**Rationale:** Highlights the specific video technology (Sora 2) and creates better brand recognition.

### 3. **FAQ Updated with Current Pricing** ✅

**File:** `src/config/pricing.config.ts`

**Changes Made:**

#### 3.1 Yearly Savings Question
**Before:**
```
Yearly plans save you 20% compared to monthly billing. For example, 
the Pro plan costs $14.90/month ($178.80/year) on monthly billing, 
but only $143.04/year on yearly billing - a savings of $35.76 per year!
```

**After:**
```
Yearly plans save you 20% compared to monthly billing. For example, 
the Pro plan costs $14.9/month ($178.8/year) on monthly billing, 
but only $143.04/year on yearly billing - a savings of $35.76 per year! 
Plus, yearly plans give you 12 months of credits upfront 
(9,600 credits for Pro, 19,200 credits for Pro+).
```

**Changes:**
- Updated decimal precision ($14.90 → $14.9)
- Added credit information for yearly plans
- Emphasized upfront credit benefit

#### 3.2 Watermark Question
**Before:**
```
No! All Pro and Pro+ plans generate completely watermark-free content 
for both images and videos. Only free plan users will see watermarks 
on their generated content.
```

**After:**
```
All plans get watermark-free images! For videos, Pro and Pro+ plans 
generate completely watermark-free Sora 2 videos. Free plan users get 
watermark-free images but do not have access to video generation.
```

**Changes:**
- Clarified that ALL plans get watermark-free images
- Specified "Sora 2 videos" instead of just "videos"
- Corrected information about free tier (no videos, not watermarked videos)

### 4. **Terms of Service Updated** ✅

**File:** `src/app/terms/page.tsx`

**Section 3.1: Subscription Plans Display**

**Before:**
```
Free: Free
Pro: $14.90/mo or $143.04/year
Pro+: $26.90/mo or $258.24/year
```

**After:**
```
Free: Free
Pro: $14.9/mo or $143.04/year (800 credits/mo or 9,600 credits/year)
Pro+: $26.9/mo or $258.24/year (1,600 credits/mo or 19,200 credits/year)
```

**Changes:**
- Updated decimal precision (1 decimal place for monthly)
- Added credit amounts for both monthly and yearly plans
- More transparent value proposition

**Implementation:**
```tsx
{plan.price.monthly === 0 
  ? 'Free' 
  : `$${plan.price.monthly.toFixed(1)}/mo or $${plan.price.yearly.toFixed(2)}/year (${plan.credits.monthly.toLocaleString()} credits/mo or ${plan.credits.yearly.toLocaleString()} credits/year)`}
```

### 5. **Refund Policy Reviewed** ✅

**File:** `src/app/refund-policy/page.tsx`

**Status:** Already accurate and aligned with credit-based system
