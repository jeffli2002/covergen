# Subscription Data Tracking Fixes - Complete Implementation

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Branch:** credits

---

## Executive Summary

Fixed all identified gaps in subscription data tracking to ensure complete audit trail for upgrades, renewals, and proration events. All subscription state changes are now properly recorded in both Supabase and BestAuth databases.

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Previous Tier Not Tracked on Upgrades → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** When users upgraded from Pro to Pro+, the system didn't record what tier they upgraded from, making audit trails incomplete.

**Solution:** Updated upgrade endpoint to track:
- `previous_tier` field
- `upgraded_from` in metadata
- Complete upgrade history array

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/app/api/bestauth/subscription/upgrade/route.ts:73-116` (Trial upgrades)
- `/src/app/api/bestauth/subscription/upgrade/route.ts:148-231` (Paid upgrades)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const previousTier = currentSubscription.tier

const upgradeHistoryEntry = {
  from_tier: previousTier,
  to_tier: targetTier,
  upgraded_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  upgrade_type: 'immediate_proration',
  billing_cycle: billingCycle,
  proration_amount: prorationAmount
}

await bestAuthSubscriptionService.createOrUpdateSubscription({
  userId,
  tier: targetTier,
  previousTier: previousTier, // ← Now tracked
  upgradeHistory: upgradeHistory, // ← Full history
  // ...
})
```

---

### 2. ⚠️ Proration Amount Not Recorded → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** System was upgrading with proration but not storing the charged/credited amount for transparency.

**Solution:** 
- Modified Creem SDK upgrade method to extract proration from invoice
- Store amount in `proration_amount` field
- Track timestamp in `last_proration_date`

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/services/payment/creem.ts:1239-1266` (Extract proration)
- `/src/app/api/bestauth/subscription/upgrade/route.ts:180-215` (Store proration)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// In Creem service
const prorationAmount = result.object?.latestInvoice?.prorationAmount || 
                         result.object?.latestInvoice?.total || 
                         null

return {
  success: true,
  subscription: result.object,
  prorationAmount: prorationAmount, // ← Now returned
  message: 'Subscription upgraded successfully with immediate proration'
}

// In upgrade endpoint
await bestAuthSubscriptionService.createOrUpdateSubscription({
  userId,
  prorationAmount: prorationAmount, // ← Stored
  lastProrationDate: prorationDate, // ← Timestamp
  // ...
})
```

---

### 3. ⚠️ No Renewal Timestamp → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** Couldn't distinguish first subscription payment from renewals.

**Solution:** Added renewal detection in `payment_success` webhook handler with tracking:
- `last_renewed_at` timestamp
- `renewal_count` in metadata
- `last_renewal_amount` in metadata

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/app/api/webhooks/creem/route.ts:283-344`

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Detect renewal vs first payment
const isRenewal = subscription.paid_started_at && 
                 subscription.status === 'active' &&
                 currentPeriodStart && 
                 new Date(currentPeriodStart) > new Date(subscription.current_period_start || 0)

if (isRenewal) {
  const renewalCount = (subscription.metadata?.renewal_count || 0) + 1
  
  await bestAuthSubscriptionService.createOrUpdateSubscription({
    userId: subscription.user_id,
    lastRenewedAt: new Date(), // ← Renewal timestamp
    metadata: {
      ...subscription.metadata,
      renewal_count: renewalCount, // ← Track count
      last_renewal_amount: amount,
      last_renewal_date: new Date().toISOString()
    }
  })
  
  console.log(`[BestAuth Webhook] Renewal #${renewalCount} tracked`)
}
```

---

### 4. ⚠️ Billing Cycle Changes Not Tracked → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** If users switched from monthly to yearly, no history was kept.

**Solution:** 
- Added `billing_cycle` field to subscriptions
- Track `previous_billing_cycle` in metadata on changes
- Include billing cycle in upgrade history entries

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/services/bestauth/BestAuthSubscriptionService.ts:320-383`
- All upgrade endpoints now track billing cycle

## Database Changes

### Migration Created
**File:** `/supabase/migrations/20251015_add_subscription_tracking_fields.sql`

### New Columns Added

#### Supabase: `subscriptions_consolidated` table
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.subscriptions_consolidated
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_renewed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS upgrade_history JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS proration_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_proration_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS billing_cycle VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'monthly';
```

#### BestAuth: `bestauth_subscriptions` table
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.bestauth_subscriptions
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_renewed_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS upgrade_history JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS proration_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_proration_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS previous_tier VARCHAR(50),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS billing_cycle VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'monthly';
```

### Indexes Created
```sql
-- Renewal query optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_subscriptions_last_renewed 
ON subscriptions_consolidated(last_renewed_at) 
WHERE last_renewed_at IS NOT NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_bestauth_subscriptions_last_renewed 
ON bestauth_subscriptions(last_renewed_at) 
WHERE last_renewed_at IS NOT NULL;

-- Upgrade history search
CREATE INDEX idx_subscriptions_upgrade_history 
ON subscriptions_consolidated USING gin(upgrade_history) 
WHERE upgrade_history != '[]'::jsonb;

CREATE INDEX idx_bestauth_subscriptions_upgrade_history 
ON bestauth_subscriptions USING gin(upgrade_history) 
WHERE upgrade_history != '[]'::jsonb;
```

---

## Service Layer Updates

### BestAuthSubscriptionService Enhanced
**File:** `/src/services/bestauth/BestAuthSubscriptionService.ts`

**New Parameters Added to `createOrUpdateSubscription()`:**
```typescript
{
  // ... existing fields
  previousTier?: 'free' | 'pro' | 'pro_plus'
  upgradeHistory?: any[]
  prorationAmount?: number | null
  lastProrationDate?: Date | null
  lastRenewedAt?: Date | null
  billingCycle?: 'monthly' | 'yearly'
}
```

**Backward Compatible:** All new fields are optional, existing code continues to work.

---

## Complete Data Flow Example

### Scenario: Pro user upgrades to Pro+ (monthly)

1. **User clicks "Upgrade to Pro+"**
   ```
   Current state:
   - tier: 'pro'
   - billing_cycle: 'monthly'
   - current_period_start: 2025-10-01
   ```

2. **Upgrade API called** (`/api/bestauth/subscription/upgrade`)
   - Captures current tier: `pro`
   - Calls Creem SDK with `proration-charge-immediately`

3. **Creem processes upgrade**
   - Returns subscription object with `latestInvoice`
   - Invoice contains `prorationAmount: 12.50` (prorated charge)

4. **Database updated with complete tracking**
   ```sql
   UPDATE bestauth_subscriptions SET
     tier = 'pro_plus',
     previous_tier = 'pro',
     billing_cycle = 'monthly',
     proration_amount = 12.50,
     last_proration_date = '2025-10-15T14:30:00Z',
     upgrade_history = upgrade_history || '[{
       "from_tier": "pro",
       "to_tier": "pro_plus",
       "upgraded_at": "2025-10-15T14:30:00Z",
       "upgrade_type": "immediate_proration",
       "billing_cycle": "monthly",
       "proration_amount": 12.50
     }]'::jsonb,
     metadata = jsonb_set(metadata, '{upgraded_at}', '"2025-10-15T14:30:00Z"')
   WHERE user_id = '...';
   ```

5. **User sees confirmation**
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "upgraded": true,
     "currentTier": "pro_plus",
     "previousTier": "pro",
     "prorationAmount": 12.50,
     "message": "Successfully upgraded from Pro to Pro+!",
     "note": "You now have immediate access to Pro+ features. Prorated charges have been applied."
   }
   ```

6. **Next renewal (1 month later)**
   - Webhook: `payment_success` received
   - System detects: `paid_started_at` exists, `current_period_start` > previous
   - Updates:
     ```sql
     UPDATE bestauth_subscriptions SET
       last_renewed_at = '2025-11-01T00:00:00Z',
       metadata = jsonb_set(metadata, '{renewal_count}', '1'),
       metadata = jsonb_set(metadata, '{last_renewal_amount}', '2690')
     ```

## Testing Checklist

### Before Testing
- [x] Run database migration
- [x] Restart Next.js server
- [x] Clear Redis cache (if applicable)

### Test Cases

#### 1. Free → Pro Trial Upgrade
```bash
# Should record:
- previous_tier: 'free'
- upgrade_history entry
- billing_cycle: 'monthly'
- trial dates
```

#### 2. Pro Trial → Pro Paid (with payment method)
```bash
# Should record:
- previous_tier: 'pro' (trialing)
- upgrade_history entry
- upgrade_type: 'trial_upgrade'
```

#### 3. Pro → Pro+ Immediate Upgrade
```bash
# Should record:
- previous_tier: 'pro'
- proration_amount: (calculated amount)
- last_proration_date: (now)
- upgrade_history entry with proration
```

#### 4. Monthly → Yearly Switch
```bash
# Should record:
- previous_billing_cycle: 'monthly'
- billing_cycle: 'yearly'
- upgrade_history entry with billing cycle change
```

#### 5. Renewal Detection
```bash
# First payment after trial:
- Should NOT trigger renewal tracking
- paid_started_at gets set

# Second payment (one month later):
- Should trigger renewal tracking
- last_renewed_at updated
- renewal_count = 1
```

## Monitoring & Queries

### Check Upgrade History
```sql
SELECT 
  user_id,
  tier,
  previous_tier,
  proration_amount,
  upgrade_history,
  last_renewed_at
FROM bestauth_subscriptions
WHERE upgrade_history != '[]'::jsonb
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Track Renewals
```sql
SELECT 
  user_id,
  tier,
  last_renewed_at,
  metadata->>'renewal_count' as renewal_count,
  metadata->>'last_renewal_amount' as last_renewal_amount
FROM bestauth_subscriptions
WHERE last_renewed_at IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY last_renewed_at DESC;
```

### Proration Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('day', last_proration_date) as date,
  COUNT(*) as upgrade_count,
  SUM(proration_amount) as total_prorated,
  AVG(proration_amount) as avg_proration
FROM bestauth_subscriptions
WHERE last_proration_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', last_proration_date)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Upgrade Path Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
  upgrade_history->>0->>'from_tier' as from_tier,
  upgrade_history->>0->>'to_tier' as to_tier,
  COUNT(*) as upgrade_count
FROM bestauth_subscriptions
WHERE upgrade_history != '[]'::jsonb
GROUP BY from_tier, to_tier
ORDER BY upgrade_count DESC;
```

## Breaking Changes

**None.** All changes are backward compatible:
- New fields are optional
- Existing subscription records continue to work
- Only new upgrades/renewals will populate the new fields

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

1. **Revert code changes:**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   ```

2. **Drop new columns (if needed):**
   ```sql
   -- Supabase
   ALTER TABLE subscriptions_consolidated
   DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS last_renewed_at,
   DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS upgrade_history,
   DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS proration_amount,
   DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS last_proration_date;
   
   -- BestAuth
   ALTER TABLE bestauth_subscriptions
   DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS last_renewed_at,
   DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS upgrade_history,
   DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS proration_amount,
   DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS last_proration_date,
   DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS previous_tier;
   ```

**Note:** Dropping columns will lose upgrade history data. Consider keeping columns and just reverting code if possible.

## Performance Impact

✅ **Minimal impact expected:**
- New indexes optimize queries on new fields
- JSONB columns use GIN indexes for efficient querying
- WHERE clauses filter out null values
- All operations are append-only (no scans of old data)

**Estimated overhead per upgrade:** < 1ms

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run database migration in production
2. ✅ Deploy code changes
3. ⏳ Monitor logs for first upgrade after deployment
4. ⏳ Verify data in database after first few upgrades
5. ⏳ Set up monitoring dashboard for upgrade metrics

---

## Success Metrics

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] All Pro → Pro+ upgrades have `previous_tier` set
- [ ] All paid upgrades have `proration_amount` recorded
- [ ] Monthly renewals increment `renewal_count`
- [ ] `upgrade_history` JSONB array populates correctly
- [ ] No errors in webhook handlers
