# OAuth Session Detection Fix

## The Problem
After OAuth redirect, the client-side code was timing out while waiting for the session, even though auth cookies were properly set by the server.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. Complex client-side session detection logic with timeouts
2. Attempting to read cookies before they were fully propagated
3. Mixing different Supabase client patterns

## The Solution

### 1. Simplified Supabase Client
Remove all custom auth configuration from the client:
```typescript
// src/lib/supabase-client.ts
export function createSupabaseClient() {
  return createBrowserClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
  )
}
```

### 2. Server-Side Session Handling
Let the server handle OAuth callbacks and session creation:
```typescript
// src/app/auth/callback/route.ts
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code)
// Cookies are automatically set by the server client
```

### 3. Removed Timeout Logic
Removed all session timeout logic from authService - let Supabase handle session detection naturally.

### 4. Simple Auth State Listener
Created a simple auth handler that listens for auth state changes:
```typescript
// src/components/auth/SimpleAuthHandler.tsx
supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {
  if (event === 'SIGNED_IN' && session) {
    router.refresh() // Refresh to pick up new session
  }
})
```

### 5. Middleware Session Refresh
The middleware automatically refreshes sessions on every request:
```typescript
// src/middleware.ts
const supabaseResponse = await updateSession(request)
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Keep it simple** - Don't add custom cookie handling or timeouts
2. **Trust the framework** - Supabase SSR handles cookies automatically
3. **Use server-side auth** - Let the server handle OAuth callbacks
4. **Middleware is key** - It refreshes sessions on every request

## For Development

The OAuth redirect to production URL issue remains, but the session is now properly detected after redirect. You can:

1. **Manual URL change** - Change the domain in the URL bar after OAuth redirect
2. **Use NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL** - Set this in `.env.local` to `http://localhost:3001`
3. **Let middleware handle it** - The session will be picked up on the next request
