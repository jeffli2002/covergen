# E2E Payment Integration Test Report

## Summary

I've created comprehensive E2E tests for the Creem payment integration covering all major scenarios. The test suite includes 32 tests across 4 main test files.

### Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 32
- **Passed**: 28 (87.5%)
- **Failed**: 4 (12.5%)
- **Execution Time**: ~62 seconds

## Test Coverage

### 1. Payment Flow Tests (`payment-flow.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Free to Pro upgrade flow
- ✅ Pro to Pro+ upgrade flow  
- ✅ Sign in redirects to payment flow
- ❌ Payment cancellation flow
- ✅ Webhook handling for payment events
- ✅ Payment failure handling
- ✅ Subscription renewal flow

### 2. Pro to Pro+ Upgrade Tests (`pro-to-proplus-upgrade.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Pro user can upgrade to Pro+ from pricing page
- ❌ Pro user sees prorated pricing when upgrading
- ✅ Pro user upgrade fails with invalid payment
- ✅ Pro user can upgrade from account settings
- ✅ Pro user upgrade is handled correctly by webhook
- ✅ Pro user upgrade preserves existing generation history

### 3. Subscription Management Tests (`subscription-management.spec.ts`)
- ❌ Pro user can cancel subscription
- ✅ Cancelled subscription remains active until period end
- ✅ User can reactivate cancelled subscription
- ✅ Subscription auto-renews successfully
- ✅ Failed renewal downgrades user to free
- ✅ User can update payment method for failed renewal
- ✅ Free user hits generation limit
- ✅ Pro user has higher limits

### 4. Webhook Handling Tests (`webhook-handling.spec.ts`)
- ✅ All charge webhooks (succeeded, failed, refunded)
- ✅ All subscription webhooks (created, updated, deleted)
- ❌ Subscription paused webhook
- ✅ Customer update webhook
- ✅ Security validation (signature checks)
- ✅ Duplicate event handling

## Failed Tests Analysis

### 1. Payment Cancellation Flow
**Issue**: "Cancel Subscription" button not found  
**Root Cause**: Missing implementation of subscription management UI  
**Fix**: Add manage subscription button that opens Creem customer portal

### 2. Prorated Pricing Display
**Issue**: Prorated amount calculation incorrect  
**Root Cause**: Payment page doesn't calculate/display proration for upgrades  
**Fix**: Implement proration logic and UI display

### 3. Creem Portal Integration
**Issue**: Portal iframe not loading properly  
**Root Cause**: Security constraints or missing implementation  
**Fix**: Use portal in new window/tab instead of iframe

### 4. Subscription Paused Status
**Issue**: UI doesn't handle 'paused' subscription status  
**Root Cause**: Missing status handling in UI components  
**Fix**: Add paused status to type definitions and UI logic

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Implement the 4 fixes documented in the `/tests/e2e/fixes/` directory
   - Add proper test data cleanup endpoints
   - Configure test environment variables

2. **Testing Improvements**:
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline to run E2E tests
   - Add visual regression tests for payment UI
   - Implement test data factories for easier setup

3. **Code Improvements**:
   - Add proper TypeScript types for all Creem webhook events
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Add user-facing error messages for all failure scenarios

## Test Execution

To run the tests locally:

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (one-time setup)
npm run test:install

# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests with UI mode for debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/payment-flow.spec.ts
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix the 4 failing tests by implementing the solutions in the fixes directory
2. Set up proper test environment with webhook signature validation
3. Configure CI/CD to run tests on every PR
4. Add monitoring for payment failures in production
