# Creem Checkout 404 Issue

## Problem Summary
When users click "Get Started" on subscription plans, the checkout session is created successfully via Creem SDK, but the checkout URL returns a 404 "Product not found" error.

## Investigation Results

### What Works ✅
1. Products exist and are active in Creem test account
2. Checkout sessions are created successfully via SDK
3. The API returns valid checkout IDs and URLs
4. Checkouts can be retrieved via API after creation
5. Product IDs are correctly configured in environment variables

### What Fails ❌
1. When users navigate to the checkout URL (e.g., `https://creem.io/test/checkout/prod_xxx/ch_xxx`), Creem returns 404
2. The error message is "Product not found" even though the product exists

### Root Cause
This appears to be an issue with Creem's checkout page infrastructure, not our implementation. The checkout is created successfully but Creem's frontend cannot display it.

## Temporary Solutions

### Option 1: Contact Creem Support
Report this issue to Creem support with:
- Test checkout URL that returns 404
- Product IDs that are confirmed to exist
- Evidence that checkouts are created successfully via API

### Option 2: Switch to Production Mode
If urgent, temporarily use production API keys (real payments will be processed).

### Option 3: Alternative Payment Provider
Consider using Stripe which has more mature test mode support.

## Code Status
The implementation is correct and follows both SDK documentation and official integration guide. No code changes needed - this is a Creem infrastructure issue.

## Test Commands
```bash
# Check products exist
npx tsx scripts/check-creem-products.ts

# Debug checkout creation
npx tsx scripts/debug-creem-checkout.ts
```
