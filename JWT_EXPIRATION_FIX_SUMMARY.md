# JWT Token Expiration Fix Summary

## Issue
When clicking the "Get Started" button on the payment page, users were encountering the error:
```
invalid JWT: unable to parse or verify signature, token has invalid claims: token is expired
```

## Root Cause
The JWT token was expiring before the payment checkout session could be created. The client-side code was not properly refreshing the token before making the API call to create a checkout session.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Made `refreshSession` method public in authService.ts
- Changed from `private async refreshSession()` to `async refreshSession()`
- This allows external services to force a token refresh when needed

### 2. Added session expiration check method
- Added `isSessionExpiringSoon(bufferMinutes: number = 5)` method to authService
- This checks if the session will expire within the specified buffer time

### 3. Updated Creem payment service to force token refresh
- Before making the API call, the service now:
  - Forces a token refresh by calling `authService.refreshSession()`
  - Validates the refreshed session has a valid access token
  - Checks if the token will expire within 1 minute and rejects the request if so
  - Provides better error handling and logging

### 4. Added proactive session refresh on payment page load
- The payment page now checks if the session is expiring within 10 minutes
- If expiring soon, it automatically refreshes the session
- If refresh fails, it redirects the user to sign in again

### 5. Improved error handling
- Added specific error detection for JWT expiration errors
- Shows user-friendly message: "Your session has expired. Please sign in again to continue."
- Automatically redirects to the sign-in page with proper return URL

## Testing
- Type checking passes without errors
- The fix ensures users always have a fresh token when attempting to make a payment
- If a token cannot be refreshed, users are redirected to sign in again

## Preventive Measures
- Sessions are now refreshed proactively when they're close to expiring
- Better error messages guide users to the appropriate action
- Comprehensive logging helps debug token expiration issues
