# Creem "Product not found" 404 Error - Fixed

## Problem Summary
Users were getting a 404 "Product not found" error when trying to access Creem checkout URLs, even though the checkout session was created successfully.

## Root Cause
The application was running in **test mode** with a **test API key** (`creem_test_7...`) but using **production product IDs** (`prod_7HHnnUgLVjiHBQOGQyKPKO` and `prod_5FSXAIuhm6ueniFPAbaOoS`). These production product IDs don't exist in the Creem test environment.

## Diagnosis Steps Performed

1. **Verified Configuration**:
   - Test mode is enabled: `NEXT_PUBLIC_CREEM_TEST_MODE=true`
   - Using test API key: `creem_test_7...`
   - Product IDs are production IDs starting with `prod_`

2. **Checked Product Existence**:
   - API calls to Creem test environment returned 404 for both product IDs
   - Confirmed these product IDs don't exist in the test account

## Solutions

### Quick Fix (Recommended for Testing)
Set test mode to false in `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CREEM_TEST_MODE=false
```

### Proper Fix (For Long-term Development)
1. **Create test products in Creem test dashboard**
2. **Add test product IDs to `.env.local`**:
   ```bash
   CREEM_TEST_PRO_PLAN_ID=<your_test_pro_product_id>
   CREEM_TEST_PRO_PLUS_PLAN_ID=<your_test_pro_plus_product_id>
   ```
3. The code has been updated to automatically use test product IDs when in test mode

## Code Changes Made

Updated `/src/services/payment/creem.ts` to support separate test and production product IDs:

```typescript
export const CREEM_PRODUCTS = {
  pro: getCreemTestMode() 
    ? (process.env.CREEM_TEST_PRO_PLAN_ID || process.env.CREEM_PRO_PLAN_ID || 'prod_7HHnnUgLVjiHBQOGQyKPKO')
    : (process.env.CREEM_PRO_PLAN_ID || 'prod_7HHnnUgLVjiHBQOGQyKPKO'),
  pro_plus: getCreemTestMode()
    ? (process.env.CREEM_TEST_PRO_PLUS_PLAN_ID || process.env.CREEM_PRO_PLUS_PLAN_ID || 'prod_5FSXAIuhm6ueniFPAbaOoS')
    : (process.env.CREEM_PRO_PLUS_PLAN_ID || 'prod_5FSXAIuhm6ueniFPAbaOoS')
}
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check current configuration**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/diagnose-creem-config.ts
   ```

2. **Verify product existence**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/verify-creem-test-products.ts
   ```

3. **Test checkout flow**:
   - Navigate to payment page
   - Click on a subscription plan
   - Verify you're redirected to a working Creem checkout page

## Environment Variable Reference

### Test Mode
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CREEM_TEST_MODE`: Set to `true` for test mode, `false` for production
- `CREEM_SECRET_KEY`: Your Creem API key (test keys start with `creem_test_`)
- `CREEM_TEST_PRO_PLAN_ID`: Test environment Pro plan product ID
- `CREEM_TEST_PRO_PLUS_PLAN_ID`: Test environment Pro Plus plan product ID

### Production Mode
- `CREEM_PRO_PLAN_ID`: Production Pro plan product ID
- `CREEM_PRO_PLUS_PLAN_ID`: Production Pro Plus plan product ID

## Next Steps

1. Either disable test mode OR create test products in Creem dashboard
2. Update environment variables accordingly
3. Test the payment flow to ensure checkout URLs work correctly
