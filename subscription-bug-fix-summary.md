# Subscription Flow Bug Fix Summary

## Bug 定位 (Bug Location)

The bug was located in `/mnt/d/ai/CoverImage/src/components/pricing-section.tsx`, specifically in the `handleSubscribe` function (lines 75-106). The issue was:

1. When an unauthenticated user clicked a Pro plan subscription button
2. The code created a **mock user** instead of checking real authentication
3. It then performed a **mock subscription upgrade** 
4. This made the button display "Current Plan" without any real sign-in

## 修复方案 (Fix Solutions)

### Implemented Solution: Integration with Real Authentication System

The fix involved modifying the `PricingSection` component to:

1. **Import necessary dependencies**:
   - Added `useAuth` hook to check real authentication state
   - Added `AuthForm` component for sign-in modal
   - Added `useRouter` for navigation
   - Added `useState` for modal and pending plan state

2. **Modified `handleSubscribe` function**:
   - Removed all mock user creation code
   - Added check for real authentication state (`authUser`)
   - For unauthenticated users: stores pending plan and shows sign-in modal
   - For authenticated users: navigates directly to payment page

3. **Added authentication flow**:
   - `showAuthModal` state controls sign-in modal visibility
   - `pendingPlan` state stores which plan user selected before sign-in
   - `handleAuthSuccess` callback redirects to payment after successful sign-in

4. **Locale handling**:
   - Added `locale` prop to support internationalization
   - Updated all navigation paths to use dynamic locale

## 验证建议 (Verification Suggestions)

### Test Steps:
1. **Clear all authentication data** (use incognito mode)
2. **Navigate to pricing section** on homepage
3. **Click "Start Pro Trial"** or "Go Pro+" button
4. **Verify sign-in modal appears** (not "Current Plan")
5. **Complete sign-in process**
6. **Verify redirect** to `/[locale]/payment?plan=[selected_plan]`

### Edge Cases to Test:
1. Clicking different plan buttons stores correct pending plan
2. Closing modal cancels the subscription flow
3. Switching between sign-in/sign-up preserves pending plan
4. Already authenticated users skip modal and go directly to payment

### Files Modified:
- `/mnt/d/ai/CoverImage/src/components/pricing-section.tsx` - Main fix implementation
- `/mnt/d/ai/CoverImage/src/app/[locale]/page-client.tsx` - Pass locale prop
- `/mnt/d/ai/CoverImage/src/app/[locale]/pricing/page.tsx` - Pass locale prop

The fix ensures proper authentication flow: unauthenticated users see sign-in modal → authenticate → redirect to payment page with selected plan.
