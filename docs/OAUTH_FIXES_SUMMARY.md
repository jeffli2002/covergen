# OAuth Popup Issues - Summary of Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ COOP (Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy) Errors
- Added `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin-allow-popups` header to `/auth/callback-popup` route
- Implemented try-catch blocks around `window.opener` access
- Added localStorage fallback for when COOP blocks postMessage communication

### 2. ✅ OAuth Code Exchange Error (PKCE)
- **Problem**: "invalid request: both auth code and code verifier should be non-empty"
- **Cause**: PKCE flow requires the code verifier to be stored in the parent window
- **Fix**: Modified flow so:
  1. Popup sends OAuth code back to parent window
  2. Parent window (which has the code verifier) exchanges code for session
  3. This maintains PKCE security requirements

### 3. ❌ Redirect to Wrong URL (Requires User Action)
- **Problem**: OAuth redirects to `/en?code=xxx` instead of `/auth/callback-popup?code=xxx`
- **Cause**: Supabase dashboard doesn't have `/auth/callback-popup` in redirect URLs
- **Fix**: User must add these URLs to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Google → Redirect URLs

## Code Changes Made

1. **`/src/app/auth/callback-popup/route.ts`**
   - Removed code exchange logic (let parent handle it)
   - Only sends OAuth code back to parent window

2. **`/src/lib/oauth-popup.ts`**
   - Updated to handle OAuth codes in addition to session data
   - Passes code to success handler for exchange in parent

3. **`/src/services/authService.ts`**
   - Added code exchange logic in `signInWithGooglePopup()`
   - Exchanges OAuth code for session when popup returns

4. **`/src/components/OAuthPopupHandler.tsx`**
   - Updated to send OAuth code to parent instead of trying to exchange

## Testing After Supabase Update

Once you've added the redirect URLs to Supabase:

```bash
# Clear cookies and test
# The popup should:
# 1. Open to Google OAuth
# 2. After auth, redirect to /auth/callback-popup
# 3. Display "Sign In Successful!"
# 4. Close automatically
# 5. Parent window receives session
```

## Current Status

- ✅ COOP errors handled
- ✅ PKCE code exchange fixed
- ⏳ Waiting for user to update Supabase redirect URLs
