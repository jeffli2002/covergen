# Creem SDK Trial Activation Limitations

## Summary

**The Creem SDK does NOT currently support instant trial activation or subscription upgrades.** The "Upgrade Instantly" feature shown in the UI is partially implemented with workarounds.

## Current Creem SDK Capabilities

### ✅ What Creem SDK CAN do:
1. Create new checkout sessions (`createCheckout`)
2. Process webhook events for subscription lifecycle
3. Handle trial periods during initial checkout
4. Verify webhook signatures

### ❌ What Creem SDK CANNOT do:
1. Update existing subscriptions (`updateSubscription` - TODO)
2. Upgrade subscription tiers (`upgradeSubscription` - TODO)
3. Cancel subscriptions programmatically (`cancelSubscription` - TODO)
4. End trials early (`trial_end: 'now'` - not supported)
5. Retrieve subscription details (`getSubscription` - TODO)

## Current Implementation Approach

### Trial Activation (Same Tier)
When a trial user clicks "Activate Plan":
1. **With Payment Method**: We update our database to mark as active, but Creem/Stripe still considers it trialing
2. **Without Payment Method**: Redirect to Creem checkout to add payment

### Trial Upgrade (Different Tier)
When a trial user clicks "Upgrade Instantly":
1. **With Payment Method**: We update our database tier, but Creem/Stripe billing remains unchanged until trial ends
2. **Without Payment Method**: Redirect to Creem checkout for new plan

### Limitations of Current Approach
1. **Billing Mismatch**: Database shows active/upgraded but Creem still treats as trial
2. **No Immediate Charging**: Users won't be charged until trial period ends
3. **No Proration**: Upgrade billing adjustments only happen at trial end
4. **Webhook Conflicts**: Creem webhooks may override our database changes

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Wait for Creem SDK Updates
- Creem needs to implement subscription management APIs
- Methods needed: `updateSubscription`, `upgradeSubscription`, `endTrial`

### Option 2: Use Stripe API Directly
- Bypass Creem for subscription updates
- Use Stripe API to manage subscriptions after initial creation
- Requires storing Stripe API keys separately

### Option 3: Remove "Instant" Features
- Only allow trial activation/upgrade through new checkout sessions
- This ensures billing is always in sync
- Better user experience with accurate billing

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Trial Activation with Payment
1. Create Pro trial user with payment method
2. Click "Activate Plan"
3. Expected: Database shows active, but no immediate charge
4. Actual billing: Happens when trial ends naturally

### Test Case 2: Trial Upgrade with Payment
1. Create Pro trial user with payment method
2. Click "Upgrade to Pro+"
3. Expected: Database shows Pro+, but Pro billing continues
4. Actual upgrade: Happens when trial ends

### Test Case 3: Trial without Payment
1. Create trial user without payment method
2. Click "Activate Plan" or "Upgrade"
3. Expected: Redirected to checkout
4. Result: Works correctly as new checkout

## Production Risks

1. **User Confusion**: Users expect immediate billing but won't be charged
2. **Support Issues**: Billing doesn't match what UI shows
3. **Refund Requests**: Users may not understand delayed billing
4. **Webhook Overrides**: Creem webhooks may revert our database changes

## Recommendation

**Do NOT advertise "Instant Upgrade" until Creem SDK supports it.** Instead:
1. Show "Upgrade at Next Billing Cycle" for trial users
2. Or always redirect to checkout for plan changes
3. Be transparent about when billing changes take effect
