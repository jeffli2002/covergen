Pls provide all needed cover pictures in all created landing pages rather than just having a placeholder.  You can search and download related cover images with suggested title and  your smart prompt, resize it  based on targeted platform requirement then feed all inputs to AI  to generate fascinating coverage image and upload them to corresponding landing pages. Ultrathink.


All downloaded images should fit the platform style.
You need to add appropriate  title and prompt （e.g.  background change, clothes change, hair style change, etc.)   to feed AI to generate cool cover image for this flatform.
In the end, the original downloaded image and AI generated image , both are supposed to be added on landing page for comparison.
