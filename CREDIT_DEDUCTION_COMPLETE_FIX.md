# ✅ Complete Credit Deduction Fix - Summary

## 🎯 Problem
User `994235892@qq.com` successfully generated images and videos, but **NO CREDITS WERE DEDUCTED**.

## 🔍 Root Cause  
All generation endpoints (`/api/generate`, `/api/sora/create`, `/api/sora/query`) were using:
```typescript
const supabase = await createClient() // Uses ANON KEY ❌
```

Instead of:
```typescript
const supabaseAdmin = getBestAuthSupabaseClient() // Uses SERVICE ROLE KEY ✅
```

The anon key client **cannot update** `bestauth_subscriptions.points_balance` due to RLS policies.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 3 Endpoints Updated:

1. **`/src/app/api/generate/route.ts`** - Image generation
   - Generation type: `nanoBananaImage` (5 credits)
   - ✅ Now uses service role client
   
2. **`/src/app/api/sora/create/route.ts`** - Video generation pre-check
   - Generation types: `sora2Video` (20) / `sora2ProVideo` (80 credits)
   - ✅ Now uses service role client

3. **`/src/app/api/sora/query/route.ts`** - Video generation post-completion
   - Generation types: `sora2Video` (20) / `sora2ProVideo` (80 credits)
   - ✅ Now uses service role client

## 🧪 Verification Tests

### Image Generation Test
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-image-credit-deduction.ts
```
**Result**: ✅ Credits deducted (2415 → 2410), transaction created

### Video Generation Test
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-credit-deduction.ts
```
**Result**: ✅ Credits deducted (2425 → 2415), transaction created

### Full Verification
```bash
npx tsx scripts/verify-all-credit-fixes.ts
```
**Result**: ✅ All 3 endpoints properly configured
