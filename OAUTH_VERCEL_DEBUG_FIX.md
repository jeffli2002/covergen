# OAuth Vercel Preview Session Fix - December 2024

## Problem Summary
Users are being redirected to the correct URL with `?auth_callback=success` parameter after OAuth flow, but they're not actually signed in. This issue specifically affects Vercel preview deployments.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Cookie Propagation Delay**: Vercel's preview infrastructure may have delays in cookie propagation across their edge network
2. **Timing Issues**: The original 500ms wait time in SessionRecovery was insufficient
3. **Session Verification**: No verification was done to ensure cookies were properly set before redirect

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Session Recovery with Progressive Retry
- Increased retry attempts from 2 to 5
- Progressive delays: 500ms, 1000ms, 1500ms, 2000ms, 3000ms
- Special handling for Vercel preview URLs with additional 1-second wait
- Better error reporting when all retries fail

### 2. Improved Debug Logging
- Added detailed cookie logging in the callback route
- Logs the number and names of auth cookies being set
- Helps identify if cookies are being properly created

### 3. Session Verification on Vercel Previews
- Added verification step specifically for Vercel preview deployments
- Attempts to read the session with the cookies just set
- Logs whether the session can be recovered immediately

## Testing Instructions

1. Deploy to Vercel Preview:
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "fix: Enhanced OAuth session recovery for Vercel previews"
   git push origin test-payment-webhooks
   ```

2. Test the OAuth flow:
   - Visit your preview URL
   - Navigate to `/auth-state-test`
   - Click "Sign In with Google"
   - Complete the OAuth flow
   - Watch the browser console for detailed logs

3. Expected Console Output:
   ```
   [Universal Auth Callback] Session established: {...}
   [Universal Auth Callback] Auth cookies being set: 3
   [Universal Auth Callback] Cookie: sb-xxx-auth-token, Length: 240
   [Universal Auth Callback] Vercel preview detected, verifying session cookies...
   [Universal Auth Callback] Session verified successfully
   [SessionRecovery] Attempting session recovery after OAuth callback...
   [SessionRecovery] Attempt 1/5 to recover session...
   [SessionRecovery] Session found on attempt 1
   [SessionRecovery] Vercel preview detected, waiting for cookie propagation...
   [SessionRecovery] UserSessionService synchronized
   ```

4. If the issue persists, check:
   - Browser console for error messages
   - Network tab for failed requests
   - Application > Cookies to verify auth cookies are present

## Debug Pages Available

- `/auth-state-test` - Compare auth states across all services
- `/auth-session-debug` - Detailed session and cookie information

## Additional Considerations

1. **Supabase Configuration**: Ensure your Vercel preview URL pattern is added to Supabase:
   - Pattern: `https://*.vercel.app/auth/callback-universal`
   - Or add your specific preview URL

2. **Browser Considerations**:
   - Some browsers with strict privacy settings may block third-party cookies
   - Ensure cookies are enabled for the preview domain

3. **Network Timing**:
   - The fix includes progressive retries to handle varying network conditions
   - Maximum wait time is now ~9.5 seconds (sum of all retry delays)

## If Issues Continue

1. Check the Supabase logs for OAuth errors
2. Verify the exact cookies being set using browser DevTools
3. Try a different browser to rule out browser-specific issues
4. Check if the issue occurs on production deployment (to isolate Vercel preview-specific issues)

## Technical Details

The fix addresses three key areas:
- **Timing**: More aggressive retry logic with progressive delays
- **Verification**: Ensures cookies are readable before completing redirect
- **Debugging**: Enhanced logging at every step of the process

This approach ensures that even with Vercel's distributed infrastructure and potential propagation delays, users will eventually get their session established.
